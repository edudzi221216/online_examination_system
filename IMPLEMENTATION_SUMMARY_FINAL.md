## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to implement the requested functionality for the Examination Management System (EMS).

## âœ… **1. Login Page - Reverted to Black and Green Theme**

### Changes Made:
- **File**: `login.php`
- **Background**: Changed from blue gradient (`#667eea` to `#764ba2`) to black (`#000000`)
- **Student Slide**: Changed from blue gradient to green gradient (`#00ff00` to `#008000`)
- **Button Colors**: Updated primary button to green (`#00ff00`) with black text
- **Focus States**: Updated border colors to green (`#00ff00`)
- **Icons**: Updated staff portal icon color to green

### Result:

- Maintains the modern design while reverting to the requested color scheme

---

## âœ… **2. Exam Management - Admin View All Exams**

### Changes Made:
- **File**: `admin/examinations.php`
- **Permission Logic**: Updated to ensure only exam creators can edit their exams
- **View Access**: Admins can view all exams regardless of creator
- **Edit Restrictions**: Admins cannot edit, add, or delete questions for exams they didn't create

### Code Changes:
```php
// Before: Admin could edit all exams
$can_edit = ($_SESSION['role'] === 'admin') || 
           ($_SESSION['role'] === 'teacher' && $row['created_by'] === $_SESSION['myid']);

// After: Only creator can edit their exams
$can_edit = ($row['created_by'] === $_SESSION['myid'] && $row['created_by_type'] === $_SESSION['role']);
```

### Result:
- Admins see all exams in the system
- Only the creator (teacher or admin) has full edit privileges
- Non-creators see "Not Authorized" messages for edit actions

---

## âœ… **3. Question Editing - Creator-Only Access**

### Changes Made:
- **Files**: `admin/examinations.php`, `teacher/examinations.php`
- **Logic**: Only exam creators can edit questions they added
- **UI**: Non-creators see disabled/read-only options

### Result:
- Teachers can only edit questions for exams they created
- Admins can only edit questions for exams they created
- Proper authorization checks prevent unauthorized access

---

## âœ… **4. Bulk Upload Button Relocation**

### Changes Made:
- **Files**: `admin/add-questions.php`, `teacher/add-questions.php`
- **Before**: Button was in page title area
- **After**: Button moved next to "Add New Questions" header in tab area

### Code Changes:
```php
// Removed from page title
<div class="page-title">
    <h3>Add Questions To The Exam - <?php echo "$exam_name"; ?></h3>
</div>

// Added next to tab header
<ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
    <li role="presentation" class="active"><a href="#tab5" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">Add New Question</a></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin: 10px 0;">
    <a href="bulk_upload_questions.php?exam_id=<?php echo urlencode($exam_id); ?>" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">
        <i class="fa fa-upload"></i> Bulk Upload Questions
    </a>
</div>
```

### Result:
- Bulk upload button is now positioned next to the "Add New Questions" header
- Button includes exam_id parameter for proper context
- Consistent placement across admin and teacher interfaces

## âœ… **5. Student Exam Access - Enhanced Dashboard**

### Changes Made:
- **Files**: `student/index.php`, `includes/student_exam_status.php`
- **Terminology**: Changed "Upcoming" to "Pending"
- **Table Structure**: Updated to show "Pending" and "Past Exams" tables
- **Button Logic**: Enhanced to handle exact timing requirements

### Key Features:

#### **Pending Exams Table:**
- Shows exams that haven't started yet
- Displays countdown timer to exam start
- "Start Exam" button is disabled until exact start time
- Button automatically becomes active at start time

#### **Active Exams Table:**
- Shows currently running exams
- "Start Exam" button is active and clickable
- Shows "Already Taken" if student completed the exam

#### **Past Exams Table:**
- Shows completed exams
- "View Question" button only active after results published
- Results considered published when:
  - Exam end time has passed
  - Student has a recorded score

### Code Changes:
```php
// Updated categorization
$exams = array(
    'pending' => array(),    // Was 'upcoming'
    'active' => array(),
    'past' => array()
);

// Enhanced button logic
function generateExamActionButton($exam, $exam_status) {
    // Checks exact timing and result publication status
    // Returns appropriate button state based on conditions
}
```

### JavaScript Enhancements:
```javascript
// Auto-enables start button when exam starts
if (timeLeft <= 0) {
    const startButton = document.querySelector('a[href*="take-assessment.php?id=' + exam.exam_id + '"]');
    if (startButton) {
        startButton.className = 'btn btn-success btn-rounded btn-sm';
        startButton.disabled = false;
    }
}
```

### Result:
- Students see "Pending" exams with countdown timers
- "Start Exam" button activates precisely at start time
- "View Question" button only appears after results published
- Automatic page refresh keeps status current

---

## âœ… **6. Student Exam Review - Results Publication Check**

### Changes Made:
- **File**: `student/view-past-exam.php`
- **Logic**: Enhanced results publication verification
- **Access Control**: Prevents viewing questions before results published

### Verification Logic:
```php
$current_time = time();
$exam_end_time = strtotime($exam_data['end_exam_date'] . ' ' . $exam_data['end_time']);
$results_published = false;

// Results published if exam ended AND student has score
if ($current_time > $exam_end_time && !empty($score)) {
    $results_published = true;
}

if (!$results_published) {
    $_SESSION['error'] = "Exam results have not been officially published yet.";
    header("Location: ./");
    exit();
}
```

### Result:
- Students can only view questions after exam period ends
- Results must be officially published (student has score recorded)
- Proper error messages guide students on access timing
